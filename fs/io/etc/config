1	LIO_PRINT_ERRORS
Print errors - as if they were typed at a keyboard.
Defaults to 0 (errors won't be printed)
Useful for debugging - place "(config 1 1)" at the start of the runfile
to get errors

2	LIO_NO_LED
Don't flash green and red LEDs when doing file access or errors
Defaults to 0 (LED is active)
(config 2 0) to turn off
(config 2 1) to turn on (the default)


8	LIO_KEYBOARD_DELAY
Specifies the default keyboard delay rate when 'printing' characters
from the (keyboard "string") function.  This is the number of milliseconds
between each stroke between 1 and 255.
(config 8 0) will set the delay rate to the system default (currently 20ms)
Most Operating Systems cannot cope with keysrokes sent at the maximum rate.
